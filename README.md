<h3 align="center">As the Horadric scholar used to say: "Hello, my friend. Stay a while and listen."</h3>  
   
I am a software developer with a strong background in clinical healthcare, skilled in programming languages such as Python (Pandas, Numpy, SciKit) and MERN stack. 
Looking forward to apply my problem-solving skills to contribute to the open-source community.
